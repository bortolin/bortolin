## About Me ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! My name is Marco, and I am the CTO at Hunext Software, where I also lead the Research and Development department. My career is centered around software development, with extensive expertise in .NET, DevOps and MAUI. I have an unbounded passion for the software and technology world, always seeking new challenges and innovations.

In addition to my work, I am deeply passionate about photography, which allows me to express my creativity and capture unique moments. Another key aspect of my professional life is training: I love sharing my knowledge and skills through teaching, helping others grow and develop in the tech field.

I am excited to share experiences, learn from other professionals, and connect with people who share my passion for technology. I look forward to meeting you on Sessionize to explore new opportunities for growth and learning together!
